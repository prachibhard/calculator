          How much more do you spend on products marketed for women?
        </h1>

            <p>
                Summer in New York is fast approaching, and that means one thing: the need for deodorant is on the rise. For women, this means spending more than men for dry underarms. Deodorant marketed for women is more expensive, as are most personal care products.
                We found that women will spend an average of $322 more than men on basic personal care items annually, a 27 percent difference. Shampoo and conditioner saw the biggest difference, with women paying almost twice as much as men for a similar
                product.

                <p>

                    A <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dca/downloads/pdf/partners/Study-of-Gender-Pricing-in-NYC.pdf">study</a> done by the NY Department of Consumer Affairs determined that women will pay more for the same products than men, just because
                    of the packaging. </p>

                <p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>

                            I just want to save money, why does it matter what products I use?”</p>
                        <p class="name">
                            - Salma Ismaeil, 22
                        </p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>

                        “The products targeted to women, while they may not explicitly include the word “women” on the packaging, have marketing that seems geared to female consumers: they are packaged in light-colored, curvy bottles,” the report said. </p>

                    <p>

                        The report determined that women pay more than men for personal care needs 56 percent of the time. Salma Ismaiel, 22, says she never noticed products marketed to men and women were priced differently. She said she sometimes uses men’s products because
                        she finds the quality to be better. </p>

                    <p>

                        “Our society objectifies and oversexualizes women and pressures us to look a certain way,” she said. “I just want to save money, why does it matter what products I use?”</p>

                    <p>

                        After realizing the number of products that are more expensive simply because they’re marketed to women, Ismaeil said she wouldn’t mind using only men’s products. </p>

                    <p>

                        "I'm definitely going to be more conscious," said Ismaeil. </p>

                    Methodology: The calculation is based on the prices of products sold in CVS, Walgreens, and Rite Aid pharmacies located in Times Square, New York. The products were chosen by identifying brands that had both male- and female-marketed products, or separate
                    male- and female-marketed brands with a similarly tiered price points (mid-tier) and similar volumes (in ounces). For the purpose of this calculation, any 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner product will be considered a “male-marketed”
                    item. The only store-brand items are the daily vitamins for women and the daily vitamins for men.
