          How much more do you spend on products marketed for women?
        </h1>

            <p>Summer in New York is fast approaching, and that means one thing: the need for deodorant is on the rise. For women, this means spending more than men for dry underarms. Deodorant marketed for women is more expensive, as are most personal care
                products.
            </p>

            <p>Women pay 13 percent more for the same personal care products, according to a <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dca/downloads/pdf/partners/Study-of-Gender-Pricing-in-NYC.pdf">study</a> about gender-pricing of goods in New York City, conducted
                by the Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) in 2015. The study covered five different industries, of which personal care had the biggest pricing difference between male- and female-marketed products. </p>

            <p>The study was an effort to encourage consumers to consider this price differential when shopping, said Christine Gianakis of the DCA. The DCA believes a lack of awareness as well as a shortage of options leads to spending more for the same
                product. </p>

            <p> “Individual consumers do not have control over the textiles or ingredients used in the products marketed to them and must make purchasing choices based only on what is available in the marketplace,” read the report.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>

                        I just want to save money, why does it matter what products I use?”</p>
                    <p class="name">
                        - Salma Ismaeil, 22
                    </p>
                </blockquote>


                <p>Salma Ismaiel, 22, says she never noticed products marketed to men and women were priced differently. She said she sometimes uses men’s products because she finds the quality to be better. </p>

                <p>

                    “Our society objectifies and oversexualizes women and pressures us to look a certain way,” she said. “I just want to save money, why does it matter what products I use?”</p>

                <p>

                    After realizing the number of products that are more expensive simply because they’re marketed to women, Ismaeil said she wouldn’t mind using only men’s products. </p>

                <p>

                    "I'm definitely going to be more conscious," said Ismaeil. </p>

                <h5>Methodology:</h5> The calculation is based on the prices of products sold in CVS, Walgreens, and Rite Aid pharmacies located within a .7-mile radius of Times Square, New York. The products were chosen by identifying brands that had both male- and female-marketed
                products, or separate male- and female-marketed brands with a similarly tiered price points (mid-tier) and similar volumes (in ounces). The only store-brand items are the daily vitamins for women and the daily vitamins for men.<br /> <br
                />For the purpose of this calculation, any 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner product is considered a “male-marketed” item, and all calculations are done as monthly purchases. These decisions do not reflect the buying habits of every consumer.
